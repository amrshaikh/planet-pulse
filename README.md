# **PlanetPulse** üåç

PlanetPulse is an AI-powered sustainability dashboard that gives a clear, human-friendly environmental health check for any city.

Built for the Octopus Hackathon (October 2025), PlanetPulse aggregates weather, UV, and air-quality data and uses Google's Gemini to generate a concise 2-sentence summary citizens can act on.

---

## üîé What it does

- Fetches live location data (geocoding) for a given city.
- Retrieves current weather (temperature, humidity, UV index) and US AQI from Open-Meteo.
- Sends the consolidated data to Google Gemini (server-side) to produce a short, actionable summary.
- Presents both the raw numbers and a friendly AI summary in a clean, responsive UI.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- AI-powered 2-sentence summaries that translate numeric data into plain language.
- Live environmental snapshot: Temperature, Humidity, UV Index, and AQI.
- Secure serverless architecture (Netlify functions) ‚Äî your Gemini API key stays server-side.
- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI with a simple animated AQI gauge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Backend: Netlify serverless functions (Node.js)
- APIs: Open-Meteo (weather, AQI, geocoding), Google Gemini (AI summaries)

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local)

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/planet-pulse.git
    cd planet-pulse
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install Netlify CLI (if you don't have it):

    ```bash
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```

4. Set up your environment and run locally:

    - Create a Netlify site or use `netlify dev` to run locally. When using Netlify, add the `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a site environment variable in the Netlify dashboard.

    ```bash
    netlify dev
    ```

5. Open your browser at http://localhost:8888 and try a city (e.g., "London").

    > Note: Without a configured `GEMINI_API_KEY` the app will still return weather/AQI data but the AI summary will show a placeholder message.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Troubleshooting

- If the UI shows a persistent loading spinner after clicking "Check Pulse":
  - Open the browser DevTools Console and Network panel to inspect the request to `/.netlify/functions/getPulse`.
  - Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Netlify only if you want live AI summaries; otherwise the function returns a mock summary.
  - The Netlify function logs (visible in Netlify dashboard) show server-side errors and helpful diagnostics.

- The project is written to be defensive about API response shapes, but external APIs can change; check logs when data is missing.

## üîÆ Future improvements

- City autocomplete (typeahead) for faster searches
- Historical charts to visualize trends
- Favorites list for quick access to frequently checked cities
- Additional localization and unit options

## üë©‚Äçüíª Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or PRs with small, focused changes. If adding features that call external services, try to make them optional or mockable for local development.
